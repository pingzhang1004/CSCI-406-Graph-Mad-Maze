# CSCI-406-Graph-Mad-Maze
###### * Using Python programming language 
###### * The course project code is not allowed to be published onlineï¼Œbut I am happy to share the ideas and results of my algorithm!
###### * I'd be happy to provide source code for interviews!


### The tricky part is how to model the maze problem as a graph.

#### During the procedure of generating such a resulting graph, we would like to obtain all moving paths/all possible moving directions for both Rocket and Lucky, and its searching strategy is built in a recursive manner.
